CRITICAL VEO3 OPTIMIZATION RULES:
1. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY: Use the EXACT same character description in each scene
2. STRUCTURE: Follow this exact format for each scene:
   - Subject: [Detailed character description]
   - Context: [Specific setting/environment]
   - Action: [Precise action/movement]
   - Camera Motion: [Specific camera movement]
   - Composition: [Shot framing]
   - Style: [Visual aesthetic]
   - Ambiance: [Lighting/mood]
   - Audio: [Sound effects and dialogue]

3. CAMERA MOVEMENTS: Use cinematic terms like "dolly in", "tracking shot", "pan left", "crane shot", "close-up", "medium shot", "wide shot"
4. AUDIO: Always include specific sound effects, ambient noise, and dialogue instructions
5. AVOID: Never use "no" or "don't" - describe what you WANT to see
6. DIALOGUE: Format as 'Character says: "dialogue text" (no subtitles!)'
7. CONSISTENCY: Repeat the exact character description verbatim in each scene

Create exactly 3 scenes that flow as a cohesive story. Each scene must be one detailed paragraph optimized for Veo3.

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a JSON array with 3 strings. No other text.

Format as JSON array with 3 strings.`;
